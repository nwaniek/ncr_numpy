/*
 * memory_guard - A simple memory scope guard
 *
 * This template allows to pass in several pointers which will be deleted when
 * the guard goes out of scope. This is the same as using a unique_ptr into
 * which a pointer is moved, but with slightly less verbose syntax. This is
 * particularly useful to scope members of structs / classes.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     struct MyStruct {
 *         SomeType *var;
 *
 *         void some_function
 *         {
 *             // for some reason, var should live only as long as some_function
 *             // is running. This can be useful in the case of recursive
 *             // functions to which sending all the context or state variables
 *             // is inconvenient, and save them in the surrounding struct. An
 *             // alternative, maybe even a preferred way, is to use PODs that
 *             // contain state and use free functions. Still, the memory guard
 *             // might be handy
 *             var = new SomeType{};
 *             memory_guard<SomeType> guard(var);
 *
 *             ...
 *
 *             // the guard will call delete on `var' once it drops out of scope
 *         }
 *     };
 *
 * Example with unique_ptr:
 *
 *            // .. struct is same as above
 *            var = new SomeType{};
 *            std::unique_ptr<SomeType>(std::move(*var));
 *
 * Yes, this only saves a few characters to type. However, memory_guard works
 * with an arbitrary number of arguments.
