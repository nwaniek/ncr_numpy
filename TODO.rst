To Do
=====
npy: load simple npy from non-seekable IO stream (TCP, named pipe)
npy: load simple npz from non-seekable IO stream (TCP, named pipe)
npy: support Eigen matrices / arrays

ndarray: implement range views for basic types (i32, i64, f32, f64, etc) that uses ndarray's get function
ndarray: implement slicing
ndarray: re-evaluate the design decision regarding ndarray_item
ndarray: evaluate where temporaries are created and try to avoid them. If unavoidable, clearly document them
